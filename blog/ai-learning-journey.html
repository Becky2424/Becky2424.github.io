                <div class="blog-post-content">
                    <p>After more than 20 years in operations management, I made a decision that surprised a lot of people: I enrolled in an AI native project development program. Here is why I did it, and what I have learned so far.</p>

                    <h2>Why AI? Why Now?</h2>
                    <p>I have spent my career solving operational problems, managing teams, and finding ways to do things more efficiently. When I started seeing how AI tools were transforming the way businesses operate, I knew I did not want to be left behind. I wanted to understand this technology, not just use it.</p>

                    <h2>The Biggest Surprise</h2>
                    <p>The biggest surprise has been how much my operations background actually helps. Understanding workflows, processes, and how teams function gives me a practical lens for thinking about where AI can make a real impact. I am not starting from scratch. I am building on decades of experience.</p>

                    <h2>What I Am Learning</h2>
                    <p>Right now, I am focused on understanding how to work with AI as a tool for project development. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning how AI models work at a high level</li>
                        <li>Understanding prompt engineering and how to communicate effectively with AI</li>
                        <li>Exploring how AI can streamline operations and decision-making</li>
                        <li>Building practical projects that combine my industry knowledge with new technology</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Advice for Others Considering the Leap</h2>
                    <p>If you are a mid-career professional thinking about learning AI, my advice is simple: start. You do not need a computer science degree. You do not need to be in your twenties. What you need is curiosity, a willingness to be a beginner again, and the understanding that your existing experience is an asset, not a limitation.</p>

                    <p>I will be sharing more about my learning journey here on this blog. Stay tuned.</p>
